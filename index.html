<h2>Savory</h2>

<p>I've been baking since I was ten years old. My mom was never a baker, she still isn't, so I decided to take matters into my own hands. I started out making brownies from the box (like a peasant), then I started using recipes. Surprisingly enough, I didn't burn the kitchen down.  </p>

<p>What I bake more often is savory things, like bread and pastry. Even though it's a lot of work, I really enjoy making my own bread. I can add whatever I want to it instead of settling with what's in the store. My favorite kind of bread to make is <a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/cheese-pesto-whirls">pesto rolls</a>, pictured below.</p>

<h2>Sweet</h2>

<p>Even though sweet things are one of my favorite things to bake, I don't do them as often. My mom usually doesn't let me very often because it requires more ingredients and it's also not very good for you. I used to make my very own apple pie a couple of years ago, which was one of my favorite things I've baked. I even had the recipe memorized, but eventually my family got tired of the same apple pie.</p>

<p>I used to bake a lot of brownies, but then I started broadening my horizons to cupcakes and cookies. My favorite cookies to bake are chocolate chip and sugar cookies. I never really tried anything too crazy with cupcakes, so I always stuck with chocolate or vanilla. I made some with <a href="http://atreatsaffair.com/chocolate-strawberry-cupcakes-with-mascarpone-frosting-recipe/">mascarpone cream frosting</a> and it was really good.</p>
